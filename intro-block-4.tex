\partintrotitle{Introduction to the fourth lesson block}
So far we have learned how to describe quantum states, we touched on the physical processes that are used in producing and manipulating these, and we have seen examples of fundamental applications of distributed quantum states.
However, we have not addressed the question of what it takes to distribute these fragile quantum states.
Now, it is time to reach for distance.
First, we discuss some of the key ideas behind and requirements for long distance communication, in particular we will focus on the challenges, both classical and quantum, that long distance presents.
Achieving this long distance communication in the quantum realm requires the use \emph{quantum repeaters}, the central technology in this book. After introducing the concepts of repeaters, this lesson block concludes with a look at the technological components used as building blocks of quantum networks.
