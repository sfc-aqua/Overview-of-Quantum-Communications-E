\partintrotitle{Introduction to the first chapter block}
In this first block of chapters, we open by introducing the entire module (or book, in this form) in Chapter 1.  All readers will benefit from reading this chapter, in order to understand the purpose and flow of the book.

Chapters 2-4 are a very brief introduction to quantum information and quantum computational notation and operations.  If you are already familiar with Dirac's ket notation for multiple qubits, you can easily skip Chapter 2; likewise, if you are familiar with density matrices for mixed states and their fidelity you can skip Chapter 3. Chapter 4 may similarly feel like familiar territory, but we encourage you to at least check out 4.1 (CHSH Game) and 4.4 (SPDC), as they have material that is not included in all introductions to the field.
